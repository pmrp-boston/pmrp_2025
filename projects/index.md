In addition to our live shows The Post-Meridian Radio Players also produces content in the studio.  This program, called PMRP Presents! Is proud to present a large range of audio drama for your listening pleasure.
<h2>In Production</h2>
<cite>PMRP Presents</cite>’ first studio project of 2020 is <span class='headphrase'><a href='/projects/renegotiation'>“The Renegotiation”</a></span> written by Kevin Kordis and directed by Laura Corliss.

The Renegotiation is the story of a blacksmith who makes a deal with… let’s just say someone who doesn’t have their best interest in mind. The fate of the blacksmith and their village is changed, but when it comes time to uphold their end of the bargain the blacksmith seeks a new deal.</big></big>

The Renegotiation will be recorded in the studio and released as an audio file.  We’ll update this page when it’s been cast, and again when the audio file is available.

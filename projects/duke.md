<h2>A Word from Our Sponsor</h2>
<cite>The Duke of Newbury Street</cite> is proudly sponsored by Bertha’s Boston Baked Borscht!  A taste so good it had to flee its native land and seek refuge here in the Cradle of Liberty.  A taste as old as the Urals, but fresh enough for the ’40s.  It’s time, Boston!  It’s time for BORSCHT!

In April and May, we presented our Halloween show, Dangerous Adventures, featuring three thrilling tales of adventure:
- In Jaimie Carlson’s original radio-drama adaptation of “The Most Dangerous Game”, a big-game hunter washes ashore on a mysterious island and winds up in another hunt — but this time as prey!
- In Michael McAfee’s “Townies and Dragons: Barrel Full of Peril”, the first episode in a new series, four friends just want to get some drinks after work. But in a world of might and magic, adventure can happen at any time!
- And in Robert J. LeBlanc’s “The Bonnie Tales of Captain Bellamy: Song of Trickery”, Bonnie captain Bonny Bellamy and her crew are the terror of the seas, but a danger to themselves!

- In April, we presented our original full-length adaptation of the science-fiction classic, Metropolis! Our first weekend was at Guild Church in Davis Square, Somerville, and our second weekend was our first time performing at Mosesian Center for the Arts in Watertown.
- In May, we were to have reprised our original adaptation of the Sherlock Holmes adventure “The Final Problem” at the Watch City Steampunk Festival in Waltham. Unfortuantely, an HVAC failure at the performance venue meant that our performance had to be cancelled, but we hope to perform this again.
- In June, we reprised two of our gender-swapped takes on Star Trek episodes, “The City on the Edge of Forever” and “Spock’s Brain”.
- In July, we performed a full-length adaptation of the very first Sherlock Holmes story, “A Study in Scarlet”.
- Our Halloween show was the 10th Anniversary performance of our adaptation of the classic horror film Night of the Living Dead, along with an original horror-comedy based on The King in Yellow

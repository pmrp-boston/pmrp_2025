# Getting started

This runs locally with Ruby 3.4.1. 

1. From the root directory, run `bundle install`.
2. To start the server, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.

The site should become available at localhost:4000.

For more instructions and troubleshooting, see the [Jekyll Documentation](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/).

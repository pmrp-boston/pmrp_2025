<h2>Santa Claus Conquers the Martians, YouTube Edition</h2>
Our annual performance of Mare Freed’s adaptation for radio drama of the classic so-bad-it’s-good sci-fi Christmas spectacular <cite>Santa Claus Conquers the Martians</cite> has become a beloved tradition.  Unfortunately due to the pandemic we couldn’t do it before a live audience in 2021, so we streamed it on YouTube, and you can watch it below.  (Embedded here is the Saturday, December 5 performance, but you can also <a href='https://youtu.be/lCEE1BjKeBk'>watch the Friday night performance</a> if you like.)  You can also <a href='/events/santa2020'>learn more about the show, including the cast and crew, on its own page</a>.

<h2>The Cask of Amontillado at Vox Pop</h2>
In 2019, PMRP <a href='/events/voxpop2019'>reprised our original adaptation of Edgar Allen Poe’s “The Cask of Amondillado”</a> at the Somerville Media Center’s VOX POP popup performance space in Assembly Row.  The Somerville Media Center recorded the performance, and you can watch it below.

More information about the performance (including cast and crew and links to earlier performances of this adaptation) is available on <a href='/events/voxpop2019'>its own page<a/>.  The video is also available <a href='https://www.youtube.com/user/SCATVSomerville'>from Somerville Community Access TV’s YouTube page</a> (look for the “VOX POP” series).  We hope to have the video of the Q-and-A session that followed the performance up as well before too long.
<h2>Byfar Hour excerpts</h2>
We have our very own <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/PostMeridianRadio">YouTube Channel</a>, with videos from some of our live performances!  Currently it’s got a bunch of sketches from the Frank Cyrano Byfar Hour, performed at the Somerville Theatre as part of our <a href='/series/bb'>Big Broadcasts</a> series.

At the 2024 Arisia science-fiction convention, the Post-Meridian Radio Players presented our gender-swapped look at the classic Star Trek episode “The Doomsday Machine”, directed and adapted by Liz Salazar from the original script by Norman Spinrad. (For information on Arisia, go to https://www.arisia.org/.)

Investigating a distress call from the USS Constellation, Captain Jane Kirk finds it dead in space with the commanding officer, Commodore Decker, alone on board with a harrowing tale of a giant planet-killing device. With Captain Kirk stranded on the broken-down starship and a distraught Decker bent on revenge, can the crew of the Enterprise survive their encounter with the planet killer and stop it from continuing its destruction?

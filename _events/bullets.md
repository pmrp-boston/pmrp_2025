The PMRP Summer Mysteries return with two Dashiell Hammett radio classics!

First, it’s hard-boiled parody in “The Adventures of Samantha Spade!” a gender flipped version of the 1940s radio series “The Adventures of Sam Spade!” In this episode detective Samantha has been framed for murdering the owner of the private schooner, the Steve Starr! It’s up to Samantha to both clear her name and find the real killer!

And in “After the Thin Man!”, we recreate the Lux Radio Theater broadcast of 1940 as murder hits close to home! Nick and Nora Charles investigate the murder of Robert Landis, the fiancé of Nora’s cousin Selma.

Hijinks and cocktails ensue.

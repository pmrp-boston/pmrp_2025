<p><strong id='Jaclyn Wilson'><span>Jaclyn Wilson</span></strong> (Stage Manager) is thrilled to be stage
    managing with PMRP once again. Though she's more prone to oversharing in her emails than keeping secrets like a spy,

    her best to stand up for The Outcasts.</p>

<p><strong id='Ray Zaslow'><span>Ray Zaslow</span></strong> (Sound Engineer) is excited to be working with

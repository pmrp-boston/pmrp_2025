Our Spring 2024 show was the premiere of local author Michael Lin’s Cold-War spy thriller, “Women Behind the Curtain”, accompanied by our recreation of the 1948 radio play “The Outcasts”.

Both audio plays were presented on stage in the style of old-time radio with actors at microphones and sound effects performed live by our talented Foley artists!

## Women Behind the Curtain
In Michael Lin’s spy thriller “Women Behind the Curtain”, directed by Jay Sekora, a French spy in the Soviet Union finds unexpected allies — and unexpected enemies!

## The Outcasts
This short radio play was part of the Lest We Forget series, commissioned by the US government after World War II to promote values of pluralism and tolerance. (Yes, that was also the time of Jim Crow — we’ve always been a complicated country.) In “The Outcasts”, directed by Kitty Drexel, a group of homeowners wonder whether prospective homebuyers are the kinds of neighbors they want — and one of them has to decide whether to risk speaking her mind.

Our [Spring 2026]({{ 'seasons/2026' | relative_url }}) show will present original radio-drama adaptations of three P. G. Wodehouse stories featuring his iconic characters Bertie Wooster, a wealthy and idle English gentleman, and his valet (and frequent saviour) Jeeves.

These three plays will be presented on stage in the style of old-time radio with actors at microphones and sound effects performed live by our talented Foley artists!

## Aunt Agatha Speaks Her Mind

*Adapted by Jeremy Branton Holstein and Phoebe Roberts.  Directed by Jeremy Branton Holstein.*

When Aunt Agatha’s pearls are stolen, it’s up to Bertie Wooster to recover them!  Can Jeeves be of assistance?

## Jeeves Takes Charge

*Adapted and directed by Phoebe Roberts.*

Bertie’s fiancé demands that he intervene to prevent the publication of his Aunt’s scandalous new book!  And what’s with this new man Jeeves who’s just entered into Bertie’s employ?

## Right Ho, Jeeves

*Adapted and directed by Jaimie Carlson.*

Betty Wooster tries to arrange a romantic match for her good friend Gussie-Fink Nottle, whilst trying to avoid her Aunt Dahlia’s demands she host the Market Snodsbury Grammar School's prize giving event! Surely a little alcohol in the tea-totalling Gussie's orange juice can't cause any trouble?

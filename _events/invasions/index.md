For Halloween 2025, the Post Meridian Radio Players are proud to present <span class='headphrase'>“The War of the Worlds and Other Invasions”</span>, three radio-drama adaptations of classic H. G. Wells stories!

<img src='man_who_could_work_miracles-100.png' align='right' width='100' height='100' />In Ron N. Butler’s adaptation of <span class='headphrase'>“The Man Who Could Work Miracles”</span>, directed by Jaimie Carlson, a skeptic discovers by accident that his wishes come true, with hilarious consequences, and tries to figure out what to do with his newfound powers.

<img class='left' src='pyle-mermaid-crop.png' width='100' height='100' />In Joanie Brittingham’s adaptation of <span class='headphrase'>“The Sea Lady”</span>, directed by Jay Sekora, a mermaid comes ashore in Newport, Rhode Island, and attempts to find her place in high society.

<img class='right' src='correa-martian-crop.png' width='100' height='100' />And in David McDowell Blue’s new adaptation of Wells’ classic, <span class='headphrase'>“The War of the Worlds”</span>, directed by Mare Freed, invaders from Mars attempt to conquer Earth, whose inhabitants have to try to survive as best they can in the face of the invaders’ superior technology.

These audio plays will be presented on stage in the style of old-time radio with actors in front of microphones and sound effects performed live by our talented Foley artists!

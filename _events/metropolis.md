The Post-Meridian Radio Players are proud to present our original full-length adaptation of the science-fiction classic, Metropolis!

Based on the original novel by Thea von Harbou and the 1927 Fritz Lang film, Metropolis tells the story of a futuristic city harshly divided between the working class and the city élites. When the son of the city's Master Builder falls in love with a beautiful working-class prophet, a class war explodes into the streets, made all the worse by the inventor Rotwang’s plan to replace the working class with humanoid machines. Can Metropolis be saved before it burns to the ground?

Mare Freed, Naomi Hinchen, Jeremy Holstein, Brian Kjersten and Michael McAfee adapted the original novel by Thea von Harbou and her screenplay for the Fritz Lang film, and Jay Sekora will direct.

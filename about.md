Founded in 2005 and based in the Boston area, **The Post-Meridian Radio Players** are a group of actors, writers, FoleyFX artists, composers, sound designers and other interested people dedicated to the preservation of radio drama, and the development of audio theater, as unique art forms. They offer live performances and studio productions of both classic tales from the Golden Age of Radio and original works by new and experienced writers, with a special emphasis on science-fiction, fantasy, and horror.

**PMRP** is now (along with our sibling group [Theatre@First](http://theatreatfirst.org)) under the umbrella of the Massachusetts Community Theatre Corporation (MCTC, which we generally pronounce "Mitsy"), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.

**PMRP** has performed in venues ranging from local churches to vintage movie houses to the city's 3000-seat Orpheum Theatre. They've also performed at [Arisia](http://arisia.org/)—Boston's largest science-fiction convention—every year since 2006. They've produced recreations of classic radio shows, such as *Fibber McGee & Molly*, *Suspense!* and a Boston-based version of Orson Welles' *War of the Worlds* broadcast. Adaptations of classic stories include *The Cask of Amontillado*, *The Legend of Sleepy Hollow*, and *The Hound of the Baskervilles*, as well as adaptations of popular sci-fi films such as *The Day the Earth Stood Still* and *Night of the Living Dead*. **PMRP**'s original productions include their sci-fi comedy series *Red Shift: Interplanetary Do-Gooder* and the Parsec Award-winning studio production *The Mask of Inanna*.

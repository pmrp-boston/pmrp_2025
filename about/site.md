<h2>Credits and Thanks</h2>
Thanks to <strong>Neil Marsh</strong>, PMRP webmaster emeritus, for his many years of managing the PMRP website.  Neil also did the design work for <em>this</em> site — although his design is much more awesome than what I’ve been able to implement so far.

Thanks to <strong>Clément Nicolle</strong> at <a href='http://www.stereo-type.net/'>StereoType</a> for permission to use his font Marcelle.  (It’s the script font in the header above.)

Thanks to <strong>Liz Salazar</strong> for a lot of work migrating content from the old web site.

For the Post-Meridian Radio Players, I’m your <strike>host</strike> webmaster, <strong>Jay Sekora</strong>.  Thank you for listening, and as always, tune in next time for another thrilling episode!
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
For questions about or problems with this website in particular (not about PMRP in general), you can send email to webmaster@pmrp.org <strong>(fixed address)</strong>.

<h2>Strange Tales of Davis Square</h2>
As part of the Somerville Arts’ Council’s <a href='https://somervilleartscouncil.org/artbeat/2022'>ArtBeat 2022</a> festival, we presented <a href='/events/artbeat2022'><cite>Strange Tales of Davis Square</cite></a>, a series of extremely short (2-3 minute) audio dramas about various locations around Davis Square, Somerville.  Did you know that Davis Square has both its own monster, and its own superhero?  And what sinister event took place in an Elm Street basement during Prohibition?  But we’ve got stories of Davis Square from even longer ago than that!

You can hear all nine short audio stories (and see the map, in case you want to take the walking tour yourself) <a href='/events/artbeat2022'>right here on our website on the <cite>Strange Tales of Davis Square</cite></a> page!

<h2>Spooky Soliloquies</h2>
The Post-Meridian Radio Players love Halloween and while we couldn’t be together in person in 2020, we still brought some Halloween treats! On Halloween, Saturday Oct. 31st, we hosted “Spooky Soliloquies” — tales told by a single reader, available for free to stream or download.  Since there are over 20 audio tracks, we’re not embedding them on this page, but you can listen to them <a href='/projects/spooky2020'>directly from the Spooky Soliloquies page</a> or stream or download them <a href='https://soundcloud.com/postmeridianradioplayers'>from our SoundCloud account</a>.
<h2>The Silver Shade: Help from the Shadows</h2>
She seeks out justice where others cannot go; she is the Silver Shade. The Post Meridian Radio Players presents an homage to the pulp adventure series of the golden age of radio. High school teacher Penelope Umberson has a super power she keeps hidden from the world, but when a student comes to her for help when a parent is framed for murder, she must learn to use her ability to set things right.

The Post-Meridian Radio Players performed <a href="/events/boskone57">“The Silver Shade: Help from the Shadows”</a>, written and directed by Michael McAfee, at Boskone 57 on February 14, and you can listen to the recording here!  See <a href="/events/boskone57">the performance’s page</a> for credits.
